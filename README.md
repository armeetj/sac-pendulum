Inverted double pendulum with Soft Actor Critic (SAC) RL model.


## Documentation
All documentation is automatically generated by `pdoc3`.  

To generate documentation, run `pdoc --html -o docs . -f`.  

Make sure you do NOT have `pdoc` and only use `pip install pdoc3` or there 
might be package conflicts.

## References
In the code, I sometimes reference back to the original paper.
